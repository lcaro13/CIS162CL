<p>Hello! I currently work in higher education as an administrative support coordinator. Prior to that I worked as an advisor and in study abroad as a program assistant. I plan to complete this certificate and hope that it will lead to a career change. I think learning new computer skills are important especially in the higher education field. I am really excited about this course.</p>

<p>My favorite page to visit is the <a href="https://doolsetbangtan.wordpress.com/">BTS lyric translation</a> page. Very helpful at explaining lyrics and cultural nuances.</p>
